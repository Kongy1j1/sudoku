CSCI 4849 Project 3

- Modifications: 

Change in Colors: make the colors have more contrast than before so that people may identify the buttons, numbers, blocks and correctness on the sudoku board.

Change in Sidebar: the side bar is a bit too big in the beginning for a "side bar".


Challenge: We tried to chagne add a solve button but it did not work well.
